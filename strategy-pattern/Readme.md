# Strategy pattern
## Notes:
  * Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one and make them interchangable
  * Let the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
  * The stratergy pattern useful for situations where it is necessary to dynamically swap the algorithms used in application.
  * Use composition instead of inheritance
